## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify potato diseases using images. The Plant Village Dataset includes various images of healthy and diseased potato leaves, making it a great resource for training and testing such models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Plant Village Dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). It consists of images of potato leaves categorized into several classes, including healthy and diseased states.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to add all required libraries to your `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-disease-classification.git
   cd potato-disease-classification
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) and extract it to a directory of your choice.

4. Update the notebook `Training.ipynb` to point to the location of your dataset.

5. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Notebook Description

- **Training.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the following sections:

  1. **Introduction**: Overview of the notebook's purpose and a brief description of the dataset.

  2. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.

  3. **Loading the Dataset**: Code to load and explore the dataset. This includes reading image files, visualizing sample images, and checking the distribution of different classes.

  4. **Filtering Potato Data**: Extract only the potato images from the dataset for further processing.

  5. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

  6. **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization.

  7. **Model Building**: Define the neural network architecture using Keras. This may include convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

  8. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

  9. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data and validate it on the validation set. This section includes setting hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate.

  10. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the results using confusion matrices and other plots.

  11. **Saving the Model**: Save the trained model and its weights for future use.

  12. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summarize the results and discuss potential improvements and future work.
